# Example "Windmill" Integration

The "_example-windmill" theme is an advanced and feature-rich option within our CMS ecosystem. Tailored for users seeking a sophisticated yet user-friendly solution, this theme enables the rapid creation of responsive websites with dynamic navigation. In contrast to its simpler counterpart, the "_example-minimal" theme, "_example-windmill" offers a broader range of features and design elements, facilitating a more sophisticated and visually appealing layout. This theme showcases how the CMS Site Module Folder is utilized to initialize its construction and deployment functionalities. You can find the repository of the CMS itself here: https://github.com/bugfishtm/fast-php-page.
